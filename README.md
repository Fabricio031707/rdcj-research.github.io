## üìö Research Areas

### Symbolic Systems

Symbolic systems study how symbols represent ideas and concepts. Our research investigates how these symbols shape our understanding of the world. We analyze various symbolic frameworks and their implications in different cultural contexts.

### Harmonic Epistemology

Harmonic epistemology focuses on the relationships between knowledge, perception, and reality. We explore how harmonic structures influence our cognitive processes and how they can lead to a deeper understanding of knowledge itself.

### Computation and Symbolic Computation

We examine the role of computation in symbolic systems. This includes the development of algorithms that can process symbolic information, enabling machines to understand and manipulate symbols in ways that mimic human cognition.

### Cultural Symbolism

Cultural symbolism plays a crucial role in shaping human experience. Our research delves into how different cultures use symbols to convey meaning, beliefs, and values, and how these symbols evolve over time.

### Open Science and Independent Research

We advocate for open science practices, promoting transparency and collaboration in research. Our independent research approach allows us to explore unconventional ideas and challenge existing paradigms.
